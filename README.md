My implementation of tutorials to learn Django REST framework.

Project is 'tutorial'

Applications (folders). The code can contain exact code as in original tutorials

tutorial/quickstart - https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/ \
tutorial/snippets - https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/ ... \
pollsapi - Inspired by tutorial https://books.agiliq.com/projects/django-api-polls-tutorial/en/latest/introduction.html but along with fixes (as for me, some things have not been logical) and complete tests.
